//! Owned, `NodeId`-indexed AST + the Prism lowering pass (ADR-0012).
//!
//! `ruby-prism` nodes borrow the parse buffer (a lifetime on every node).
//! Threading that lifetime through the inference engine reproduces the
//! pervasive-`'a` pain ADR-0005/0006 deliberately avoid, so [`lower`] walks the
//! borrowed Prism tree exactly once and produces *owned* nodes keyed by a dense
//! [`NodeId`]. Inference and rules then walk this owned arena, never the
//! borrowed Prism tree.
//!
//! The owned node *shape* mirrors Prism's (rather than normalizing to a
//! semantically different HIR) so node-level behaviour stays aligned with the
//! reference for diagnostic-set parity (ADR-0002/0012). The long tail of Prism
//! nodes still lowers to [`Node::Other`] so an unhandled construct never aborts
//! the walk.
//!
//! ## Recursive structural lowering
//!
//! Beyond the top-level literal/call subset, [`lower`] recurses into the bodies
//! of definitions (`def`/`class`/`module`/singleton class), control flow
//! (`if`/`unless`/ternary, `case`/`when`/`in`, `while`/`until`/`for`,
//! `begin`/`rescue`/`ensure`, `&&`/`||`), blocks (`foo { ... }`), and into the
//! receivers/values of variable, constant, array, hash, index, range and
//! string-interpolation nodes. The point is reachability: EVERY nested call
//! lands in the arena as a [`Node::Call`], so the single rule walk
//! (`ast.iter()` filtering `Node::Call`) analyses calls inside a method/branch
//! body, not just top-level ones. Structural variants carry child [`NodeId`]s so
//! the typer can recurse into a receiver/argument; constructs we don't type
//! precisely still get their children lowered (and so analysed).
